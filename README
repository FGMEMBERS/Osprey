# Fly-By-Wire #

Properties located in /v22/pfcs/. Boolean values can be toggled by holding Ctrl
button while click on the property. If you hold Shift while clicking on a property, it will
display the property on the screen.

## Modes ##

Modes are enabled or disabled via properties in active/. Some properties
like roll-rate-bank-angle are read-only or get automatically enabled if
certain other properties become true.

## Limits ##

The minimum and maximum g force limits are read-only and depend on the
airspeed and whether the aircraft is in VTOL or APLN mode.

## VTOL factors ##

Depending on the tilt of the nacelles and the airspeed, several factors
are computed which control how effective the VTOL flight controls are.
These factors are read-only and can be found in output/vtol/

    - Differential Collective Pitch (DCP) controls the roll
    - Lateral Swashplate Gearing (LSG) provides lateral movement
    - Longitudinal Swashplate Tilting (LST) controls the pitch 
    - Differential Swashplate Tilting (DST) controls the yaw
