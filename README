# Fly-By-Wire #

Properties located in /v22/pfcs/. Boolean values can be toggled by holding Ctrl
button while click on the property. If you hold Shift while clicking on a property, it will
display the property on the screen.

## Modes ##

Ctrl + left mouse click to toggle various FBW modes:

active/
    bank-angle-hard-limit       (controls hard bank angle limit)
    pitch-hold                  (true if and only if enabling Pitch Hold in Autopilot Settings window)
    pitch-rate                  (always true if pitch-hold is true)
    roll-hold                   (true if and only if enabling Wings Level in Autopilot Settings window)
    roll-rate                   (always true if roll-hold is true)
    roll-rate-bank-angle        (read only, automatically becomes true if close to bank limit)
    yaw-rate                    (currently only used for VTOL)

## Settings ##

    direct-pitch-rate-gain      (factor used if active/pitch-rate is false, max 1.0)
    direct-roll-rate-gain       (factor used if active/roll-rate is false, max 1.0)
    pitch-hold-max              (used if active/pitch-hold is true)
    pitch-hold-min              (used if active/pitch-hold is true)
    pitch-rate-limit            (used if active/pitch-rate is true)
    roll-hold-limit             (used if active/roll-hold is true)
    roll-rate-limit             (used if active/roll-rate is true)
    yaw-rate-limit              (used if active/yaw-rate is true)

    vtol/
        direct-pitch-rate-gain  (factor used if active/pitch-rate is false)
        direct-roll-rate-gain   (factor used if active/roll-rate is false)
        direct-yaw-rate-gain    (factor used if active/yaw-rate is false
        direct-lateral-move-gain

## VTOL factors ##

Following properties are read-only factors (between 0 and 1). If both
dcp-* values are 1.0 then DCP is fully effective, etc.

output/vtol/
    dcp-airspeed
    dcp-tilt
    lsg-airspeed
    lsg-tilt
    lst-tilt
    dst-tilt
